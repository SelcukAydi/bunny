## TODO
1) Passing the ID as an integer is not readable. Wrap it into a class.
2) Only primitive types must use ID values in their key.
3) Primitive types may belong to any container or complex types.
4) Foldering structure must be done.
5) If any key does exist when composing it then throw an exception.
